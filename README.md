# The News

**What is it:**
Homework #18:
On this assignment, I created a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. By using news from another site, users can leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments remain saved unless the user decides to delete them. All stored comments remain visible to every user.
